# proz-prog
This github repository is used for the weekly exercises of the "Prozeduale Programmierung" course at the TU Hamburg. The work happened in a team of three.

Contents that we learned during this course are:
- Principles of procedural programming in C
- basis data types
- higher data types like pointers, arrays, strings, structs, etc.
- recursion
- concatenated lists like trees and circles
- sorting algorithms like quicksort and mergesort
